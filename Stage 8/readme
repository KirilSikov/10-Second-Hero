IMPORTANT NOTE: The game by itself exceeds the 
memory limit of the default settings within 
Steem. Make sure that the memory size within
Steem is greater than 1MB (choose 4MB in options > machine).
You will need to cold reset the Steem emulator
in order for memory changes to take effect. This
option can be found at the bottom of the machine
settings.
